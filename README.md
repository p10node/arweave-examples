# Arweave Examples

This repository contains example scripts related to the **Arweave ecosystem**, including tools and use cases from **AO**, **AR.IO**, and more. It's meant to provide you with practical and ready-to-use code snippets.

Iâ€™ll be adding more examples daily to make this collection as complete as possible.  

*(Eventually, I may turn this into a utility library)*

## Usage

### Scripts

You can modify the parameters directly in each script file to use them immediately, or integrate the logic into your more complex applications.
